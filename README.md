    <h4>Development Environment</h4>
<p>
I am a fancier of Sublime Text and Vim,
my setups are respectively <a href="https://github.com/Endermanbugzjfc/sublime-text-config">here</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/Endermanbugzjfc/nvim-config">there</a>.
I have experience with JetBrains IDEs and currently use NvChad ordinarily.
Occasionally, VSCode via GitHub Codespace is my secondary choice when my device is unavailable.

For version control,
I use Git CLI or Sublime Merge depending on the situation.
</p>
    <h4>Operating System</h4>
<p>
I have experience with Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu.
Furthermore, I stayed on each of them for at least three years.
</p>
    <h4>Goal and Pathway</h4>
<p>
I set my sights on mastering advanced Rust and discovering new frameworks for other languages.
</p>
    <h4>Social</h4>
<p>
Being an old member of the PocketMine-MP community,
I am highly active on its <a href="https://discord.gg/DYSEf2WGPQ">Discord Server</a>.
<code>zjfc</code> is my Discord tag.

I tend to be apathetic towards other social networking platforms.
If you wish to enquire further,
please email me at <a href="mailto:endermanbugzjfc@gmail.com">endermanbugzjfc@gmail.com</a>.
It might take a while for me to catch the information,
therefore I appreciate your patience.
