# Polygot Javelin Configuration

## About Polygot
[Polygot](https://stenokeyboards.com/products/polyglot-keyboard) is a specialised keyboard developed by Stenokeyboard that supports both stenography and traditional typing in an [ortho-linear](https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/what-is-an-ortholinear-keyboard/) layout.

## About Javelin
[Javelin](https://lim.au/#/software/javelin-steno) is a customisable firmware created specifically for customising stenography keyboards and implementing embedded steno.
Javelin includes features such as custom key mappings, multiple layers, and advanced steno capabilities,
making it my first choice compared to the [official firmware](https://github.com/petercpark/stenokeyboards-firmware/tree/master/polyglot_v1) provided by Stenokeyboard.

## My Configuration
### Features
- **Centered Shift and Space Key:** This setup positions the Shift and Space keys at the centre of the keyboard,
making them easier to reach with my thumb.

- **Functions Layer Merged into Navigation Layer:** reduces the number of layers.

- **Quick-Steno Mode:** In this mode,
steno keys are active when the quick-steno key is pressed and is [fired once it is released.]()
